- **Q: How does ENVy work?**
  - ENVy helps projects by making it very easy for projects to use Docker for environment setup. Most aspects of managing Docker container lifecycles are handled transparently, without the need for project maintainers to think about what needs to happen at each step.
- **Q: How can I support the project?**
  - The best way to help ENVy is to _use it_! With your help, we can learn how projects use ENVy in the real world, and make your use cases easier for you to configure. Please file [issues](https://github.com/envy-project/envy/issues) for any problems you encounter!
